# Mission Statement
Implement comprehensive quality assurance with test coverage analysis, quality metrics, coverage reporting, and gap analysis for quality validation in DafnckMachine v3.1.

# Description
This task covers the development and execution of quality assurance processes, including test coverage analysis, quality metrics, coverage reporting, and gap analysis to ensure comprehensive quality validation.

# Super-Prompt
You are @test-orchestrator-agent responsible for implementing quality assurance and test coverage for DafnckMachine v3.1. Your mission is to develop and execute test coverage analysis, quality metrics, and reporting to ensure comprehensive quality validation and gap identification.

# Agent Selection Criteria
The @test-orchestrator-agent is selected for its expertise in quality assurance, coverage analysis, and reporting. The @functional-tester-agent supports with test development and validation.

# Tasks (Summary)
- Develop and execute test coverage analysis and reporting
- Implement quality gates and validation

# Subtasks (Detailed)
## Subtask 1: Test Coverage Analysis & Reporting
- **ID**: P04-S15-T07-S01
- **Description**: Develop test coverage analysis with quality metrics and gap identification.
- **Agent**: @test-orchestrator-agent
- **Documentation**: [Test_Coverage_Analysis.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/15_Automated_Testing/Test_Coverage_Analysis.md), [Quality_Metrics_Framework.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/15_Automated_Testing/Quality_Metrics_Framework.json)
- **Steps**:
    1. Implement test coverage analysis with quality metrics and reporting (edit_file)
    2. Generate coverage reports and analyze quality metrics (run_terminal_cmd)
- **Success Criteria**:
    - Test coverage analysis documented and covers code coverage, quality metrics, and gap analysis
    - Coverage analysis completed successfully

## Subtask 2: Quality Gates & Validation
- **ID**: P04-S15-T07-S02
- **Description**: Develop quality gates with validation criteria and automated quality checks.
- **Agent**: @test-orchestrator-agent
- **Documentation**: [Quality_Gates_Implementation.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/15_Automated_Testing/Quality_Gates_Implementation.md), [Validation_Criteria.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/15_Automated_Testing/Validation_Criteria.json)
- **Steps**:
    1. Implement quality gates with validation criteria and automated checks (edit_file)
    2. Configure release criteria and quality validation workflows (run_terminal_cmd)
- **Success Criteria**:
    - Quality gates documented and cover validation rules, automated checks, and release criteria
    - Quality gates configured successfully

# Rollback Procedures
- Debug and fix failing coverage or quality gates
- Revert to previous implementation if validation fails

# Integration Points
- Quality assurance ensures comprehensive testing and quality validation

# Quality Gates
- All coverage and quality gates pass

# Success Criteria
- Application meets quality and coverage requirements

# Risk Mitigation
- Escalate to @coverage-analysis-lead or @quality-gates-lead if tests fail after 3 attempts
