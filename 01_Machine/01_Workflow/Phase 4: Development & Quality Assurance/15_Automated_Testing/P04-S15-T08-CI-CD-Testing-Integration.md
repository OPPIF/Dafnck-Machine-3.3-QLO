# Mission Statement
Integrate comprehensive testing in CI/CD pipelines with automated execution, parallel testing, and result integration for continuous quality validation in DafnckMachine v3.1.

# Description
This task covers the integration of testing into CI/CD pipelines, including automated execution, parallel testing, and result integration to ensure continuous quality validation and feedback.

# Super-Prompt
You are @development-orchestrator-agent responsible for integrating testing into CI/CD pipelines for DafnckMachine v3.1. Your mission is to configure automated test execution, parallel testing, and result integration to enable continuous quality validation and feedback.

# MCP Tools Required
- edit_file
- run_terminal_cmd

# Result We Want
- Comprehensive CI/CD testing integration with automated execution and result reporting
- Continuous testing and feedback enabled

# Add to Brain
- CI/CD testing integration and automation

# Primary Responsible Agent
@development-orchestrator-agent

# Supporting Agents
- @test-orchestrator-agent

# Agent Selection Criteria
The @development-orchestrator-agent is selected for its expertise in CI/CD, pipeline integration, and automation. The @test-orchestrator-agent supports with testing and feedback systems.

# Tasks (Summary)
- Integrate testing in CI/CD pipeline with automated execution and parallel testing
- Implement continuous testing and feedback systems

# Subtasks (Detailed)
## Subtask 1: Pipeline Testing Integration
- **ID**: P04-T08-S01
- **Description**: Integrate testing in CI/CD with pipeline testing stages, automated execution, parallel testing, and result integration.
- **Agent**: @development-orchestrator-agent
- **Documentation**: [CI_CD_Testing_Integration.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/15_Automated_Testing/CI_CD_Testing_Integration.md), [Pipeline_Testing_Configuration.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/15_Automated_Testing/Pipeline_Testing_Configuration.json)
- **Steps**:
    1. Integrate testing in CI/CD pipeline with automated execution and parallel testing (edit_file)
    2. Setup pipeline testing stages and result reporting (run_terminal_cmd)
- **Success Criteria**:
    - CI/CD testing integration documented and covers pipeline stages, automated execution, parallel testing, and result integration
    - CI/CD testing integration configured successfully

## Subtask 2: Continuous Testing & Feedback
- **ID**: P04-T08-S02
- **Description**: Implement continuous testing with automated feedback, test result analysis, quality dashboards, and notification systems.
- **Agent**: @test-orchestrator-agent
- **Documentation**: [Continuous_Testing_Framework.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/15_Automated_Testing/Continuous_Testing_Framework.md), [Feedback_Systems_Setup.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/15_Automated_Testing/Feedback_Systems_Setup.json)
- **Steps**:
    1. Implement continuous testing with automated feedback and quality dashboards (edit_file)
    2. Configure notification systems and quality monitoring (run_terminal_cmd)
- **Success Criteria**:
    - Continuous testing documented and covers automated feedback, test result analysis, quality dashboards, and notification systems
    - Continuous testing configured successfully

# Rollback Procedures
- Debug and fix failing CI/CD or continuous testing integration
- Revert to previous implementation if validation fails

# Integration Points
- CI/CD integration enables continuous testing and automated quality validation

# Quality Gates
- All CI/CD and continuous testing integrations pass

# Success Criteria
- Application meets CI/CD and continuous testing requirements

# Risk Mitigation
- Escalate to @pipeline-integration-lead or @continuous-testing-lead if tests fail after 3 attempts
