# Mission Statement
Implement comprehensive unit testing with test case development, code coverage analysis, mocking frameworks, and assertion libraries for foundational quality validation in DafnckMachine v3.1.

# Description
This task covers the development and execution of unit tests, including test case creation, code coverage analysis, use of mocking frameworks, and assertion libraries to ensure foundational code quality and regression prevention.

# Super-Prompt
You are @functional-tester-agent responsible for implementing unit testing for DafnckMachine v3.1. Your mission is to develop comprehensive unit tests, maximize code coverage, and ensure reliable code validation using best practices in test development and coverage analysis.

# MCP Tools Required
- edit_file
- run_terminal_cmd

# Result We Want
- Comprehensive unit tests with high code coverage
- Reliable test execution and coverage reporting

# Add to Brain
- Unit testing implementation and coverage analysis

# Documentation & Templates
- [Unit_Testing_Implementation.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/15_Automated_Testing/Unit_Testing_Implementation.md)
- [Test_Coverage_Analysis.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/15_Automated_Testing/Test_Coverage_Analysis.json)

# Primary Responsible Agent
@functional-tester-agent

# Supporting Agents
- @test-orchestrator-agent

# Agent Selection Criteria
The @functional-tester-agent is selected for its expertise in unit testing, test development, and coverage analysis. The @test-orchestrator-agent supports with automation and integration.

# Tasks (Summary)
- Develop unit tests and maximize code coverage
- Execute unit tests and generate coverage reports

# Subtasks (Detailed)
## Subtask 1: Unit Test Development & Coverage
- **ID**: P04-S15-T02-S01
- **Description**: Develop unit tests with comprehensive coverage and validation.
- **Agent**: @functional-tester-agent
- **Documentation**: [Unit_Testing_Implementation.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/15_Automated_Testing/Unit_Testing_Implementation.md), [Test_Coverage_Analysis.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/15_Automated_Testing/Test_Coverage_Analysis.json)
- **Steps**:
    1. Implement comprehensive unit testing with test case development and coverage analysis (edit_file)
    2. Execute unit tests and generate coverage reports (run_terminal_cmd)
- **Success Criteria**:
    - Unit testing implementation documented and covers all major code paths
    - Code coverage > 80%
    - Unit tests pass successfully

## Subtask 2: Test Automation & Continuous Execution
- **ID**: P04-S15-T02-S02
- **Description**: Implement test automation with automated test execution, test scheduling, parallel testing, and result reporting for continuous quality validation.
- **Agent**: @test-orchestrator-agent
- **Documentation**: [Test_Automation_Implementation.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/15_Automated_Testing/Test_Automation_Implementation.md), [Continuous_Testing_Setup.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/15_Automated_Testing/Continuous_Testing_Setup.json)
- **Steps**:
    1. Implement automated test execution with scheduling and parallel testing (run_terminal_cmd)
    2. Configure result reporting and continuous testing integration (edit_file)
- **Success Criteria**:
    - Automated test execution and reporting configured
    - Continuous testing integration established

# Rollback Procedures
- Debug and fix failing unit tests
- Revert to previous test implementation if coverage drops or tests fail

# Integration Points
- Unit testing provides foundation for quality validation and regression prevention

# Quality Gates
- Code coverage > 80%
- All unit tests pass

# Success Criteria
- High code coverage and reliable test execution

# Risk Mitigation
- Escalate to @unit-testing-lead if tests fail after 3 attempts
