# Mission Statement
Establish comprehensive test framework architecture with testing layers, automation strategy, framework selection, and integration points for scalable automated testing in DafnckMachine v3.1.

# Description
This task covers the design and configuration of the test framework architecture, including the selection of frameworks, definition of testing layers, automation strategy, and integration points to enable scalable and maintainable automated testing.

# Super-Prompt
You are @test-orchestrator-agent responsible for designing and configuring the test framework architecture for DafnckMachine v3.1. Your mission is to create a robust, scalable, and maintainable testing foundation using modern frameworks, automation strategies, and integration best practices. Document all decisions and ensure the architecture supports all required testing types and continuous integration.

# MCP Tools Required
- edit_file
- run_terminal_cmd

# Result We Want
- Documented test framework architecture with clear testing layers and automation strategy
- Configured testing environment and framework integration
- Foundation for all subsequent automated testing tasks

# Add to Brain
- Test framework architecture and automation strategy
- Integration points for all testing workflows

# Tasks (Summary)
- Design test framework architecture
- Configure testing environment and framework integration

# Subtasks (Detailed)
## Subtask 1: Test Framework Design & Configuration
- **ID**: P04-S15-T01-S01
- **Description**: Design test framework architecture with testing layers, automation strategy, framework selection, and integration points.
- **Agent**: @test-orchestrator-agent
- **Documentation**: [Test_Framework_Architecture.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/15_Automated_Testing/Test_Framework_Architecture.md), [Testing_Strategy_Design.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/15_Automated_Testing/Testing_Strategy_Design.json)
- **Steps**:
    1. Design comprehensive test framework architecture with testing layers and automation strategy (edit_file)
    2. Configure testing environment setup and framework integration (run_terminal_cmd)
- **Success Criteria**:
    - Test framework architecture plan exists and documents testing layers, automation strategy, framework selection, and integration points
    - Testing environment is configured and integrated successfully

# Rollback Procedures
- Debug framework issues and revalidate architecture
- Revert to previous stable configuration if integration fails

# Integration Points
- Guides all subsequent testing implementation and automation workflows

# Quality Gates
- Architecture reviewed and approved by @test-orchestrator-agent
- Environment setup validated by test execution

# Success Criteria
- Documented architecture and working environment setup

# Risk Mitigation
- Escalate to @test-lead if framework or integration fails after 3 attempts

# Output Artifacts
- [Test_Framework_Architecture.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/15_Automated_Testing/Test_Framework_Architecture.md)
- [Testing_Strategy_Design.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/15_Automated_Testing/Testing_Strategy_Design.json)

# Next Action
Design test framework architecture with @test-orchestrator-agent

# Post-Completion Action
Proceed to P04-S15-T02-Unit-Testing-Implementation.md
