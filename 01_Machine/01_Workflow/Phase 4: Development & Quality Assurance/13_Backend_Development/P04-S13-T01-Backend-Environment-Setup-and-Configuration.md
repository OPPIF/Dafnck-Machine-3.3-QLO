# Super Prompt
You are @coding-agent, @system-architect-agent, @security-auditor-agent, @development-orchestrator-agent, and @test-orchestrator-agent. Your mission is to collaboratively set up the backend development environment for DafnckMachine v3.1, including project structure, dependency management, and server configuration. Ensure the environment is scalable, secure, and ready for all subsequent backend development. Document all setup steps and configurations. Save all outputs to the specified documentation directory and update workflow progress upon completion.

1. **Documentation Reference**
   - Documentation in  : `01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/13_Backend_Development/`

2. **Collect Data/Input**
   - Reference backend architecture and environment requirements
   - Review previous environment setup documentation if available
   - Gather standards for dependency management, server configuration, and security

3. **Save Output**
   - Save backend environment setup guide: `Backend_Environment_Setup.md`
   - Save server configuration: `Server_Configuration.json`
   - Minimal JSON schema example for server configuration:
     ```json
     {
       "server": "express",
       "port": 8000,
       "env": "development",
       "dependencies": ["express", "dotenv"]
     }
     ```

4. **Update Progress**
   - Upon completion, update `Step.json` and `DNA.json` to mark this task as SUCCEEDED
   - Proceed to the next task: P04-S13-T02

5. **Self-Check**
   - [ ] All required files are present in the documentation directory
   - [ ] Backend environment is functional and secure
   - [ ] Documentation and configuration are clear and complete
   - [ ] Task status updated in workflow tracking files

- [Server_Configuration.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/13_Backend_Development/Server_Configuration.json)

## Primary Responsible Agent
@coding-agent

## Supporting Agents
- @system-architect-agent
- @security-auditor-agent
- @development-orchestrator-agent
- @test-orchestrator-agent

## Agent Selection Criteria
@coding-agent is chosen for its expertise in backend environment setup, server initialization, and dependency management.

## Tasks (Summary)
- Initialize backend project structure and install core dependencies
- Configure development server and environment variables
- Verify backend environment functionality

## Subtasks (Detailed)
### Subtask-01: Development Environment Initialization
- **Agent**: @coding-agent
- **Documentation Links**: Backend_Environment_Setup.md, Server_Configuration.json
- **Steps**:
    1. Initialize backend project structure and install core dependencies (run_terminal_cmd)
        - Success: Exit Code 0, package.json or requirements.txt, node_modules/ or venv/, "Successfully installed"
    2. Configure development server and environment variables (edit_file)
        - Success: scripts.dev, scripts.start, .env.example
    3. Verify backend environment functionality (run_terminal_cmd)
        - Success: Exit Code 0, GET http://localhost:8000/health returns 200 OK, "Server running on port"
- **Final Subtask Success Criteria**: Complete backend development environment with functional server, dependency management, and environment configuration successfully initialized and verified.
- **Integration Points**: Enables all subsequent backend development tasks including API creation, database integration, and testing.
- **Next Subtask**: P04-T01-S02 (Framework Integration & Middleware Setup)

### Subtask-02: Framework Integration & Middleware Setup
- **Agent**: @coding-agent
- **Documentation Links**: Framework_Configuration_Guide.md, Middleware_Setup.json
- **Steps**:
    1. Configure backend framework and routing system (edit_file)
        - Success: src/routes/ or routes/, "router", "middleware"
    2. Integrate error handling and logging middleware (edit_file)
        - Success: "error.*handler", "logging", "cors"
    3. Verify framework integration and middleware functionality (run_terminal_cmd)
        - Success: Exit Code 0, GET http://localhost:8000/api/test returns 200 OK, "Framework successfully configured"
- **Final Subtask Success Criteria**: Framework integration completed with functional middleware, routing system, and error handling verified and operational.
- **Integration Points**: Foundation for API development, request processing, and scalable server architecture.
- **Next Subtask**: P04-T02-S01 (API Architecture Design)

## Rollback Procedures
- Revert to previous environment configuration
- Reinstall dependencies
- Restore from backup if initialization fails

## Integration Points
- Enables all subsequent backend development tasks

## Quality Gates
- Functional server startup
- Dependency management
- Environment configuration

## Success Criteria
- Backend environment initialized
- Server runs successfully
- Dependencies installed
- Environment variables configured

## Risk Mitigation
- Use version control for configuration files
- Validate environment with test endpoints
- Document all setup steps

## Output Artifacts
- package.json or requirements.txt
- node_modules/ or venv/
- .env.example
- Server configuration files

## Next Action
