# Super Prompt
You are @coding-agent, @security-auditor-agent, and @test-orchestrator-agent. Your mission is to collaboratively implement secure authentication and user management APIs for DafnckMachine v3.1, including JWT, password hashing, session management, and RBAC. Ensure all specifications are secure, tested, and ready for integration. Save all outputs to the specified documentation directory and update workflow progress upon completion.

1. **Documentation Reference**
   - Documentation in  : `01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/13_Backend_Development/`

2. **Collect Data/Input**
   - Reference authentication and user management requirements
   - Review previous authentication and RBAC documentation if available
   - Gather standards for JWT, password hashing, and access control

3. **Save Output**
   - Save authentication implementation guide: `Authentication_Implementation.md`
   - Save JWT configuration: `JWT_Configuration.json`
   - Save user management API docs: `User_Management_APIs.md`
   - Save RBAC configuration: `RBAC_Configuration.json`
   - Minimal JSON schema example for JWT config:
     ```json
     {
       "algorithm": "HS256",
       "expiresIn": "1h",
       "issuer": "dafnckmachine"
     }
     ```

4. **Update Progress**
   - Upon completion, update `Step.json` and `DNA.json` to mark this task as SUCCEEDED
   - Proceed to the next task: P04-S13-T04

5. **Self-Check**
   - [ ] All required files are present in the documentation directory
   - [ ] Authentication and user management APIs are secure and tested
   - [ ] Documentation and configuration are clear and complete
   - [ ] Task status updated in workflow tracking files

## Mission Statement
Implement comprehensive authentication system with user management APIs, JWT token handling, and role-based access control for secure backend services.

## Description
This task covers the implementation of authentication and user management APIs, including JWT token handling, password hashing, session management, and role-based access control for secure backend services.

## Super-Prompt
You are @coding-agent. Your mission is to implement secure authentication and user management APIs for DafnckMachine v3.1, including JWT, password hashing, session management, and RBAC.

## MCP Tools Required
- edit_file
- run_terminal_cmd
- mcp_taskmaster-ai_get_task
- mcp_taskmaster-ai_set_task_status

## Result We Want
- Authentication system implemented with JWT tokens, secure password handling, and verified functionality for user authentication and management.

## Add to Brain
- Security Framework: Authentication, authorization, and data protection
- User Management: Role-based access control, permission systems, user profile management

## Documentation & Templates
- [Authentication_Implementation.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/13_Backend_Development/Authentication_Implementation.md)
- [JWT_Configuration.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/13_Backend_Development/JWT_Configuration.json)
- [User_Management_APIs.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/13_Backend_Development/User_Management_APIs.md)
- [RBAC_Configuration.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/13_Backend_Development/RBAC_Configuration.json)

## Primary Responsible Agent
@coding-agent

## Supporting Agents
- @security-auditor-agent
- @test-orchestrator-agent

## Agent Selection Criteria
@coding-agent is chosen for its expertise in authentication, JWT handling, and user management API implementation.

## Tasks (Summary)
- Implement JWT authentication and token management
- Configure password hashing and security protocols
- Test authentication system functionality
- Implement user management APIs and profile handling
- Configure role-based access control system
- Test user management and RBAC functionality

## Subtasks (Detailed)
### Subtask-01: Authentication System Implementation
- **Agent**: @coding-agent
- **Documentation Links**: Authentication_Implementation.md, JWT_Configuration.json
- **Steps**:
    1. Implement JWT authentication and token management (edit_file)
        - Success: "jwt", "token", "authentication"
    2. Configure password hashing and security protocols (edit_file)
        - Success: "bcrypt" or "argon2", "hash", "salt"
    3. Test authentication system functionality (run_terminal_cmd)
        - Success: POST /api/auth/login 200 OK, POST /api/auth/logout 200 OK, authentication-test-suite
- **Final Subtask Success Criteria**: Authentication system implemented with JWT tokens, secure password handling, and verified functionality for user authentication.
- **Integration Points**: Provides security foundation for all protected endpoints and user session management.
- **Next Subtask**: P04-T03-S02 (User Management & Role-Based Access Control)

### Subtask-02: User Management & Role-Based Access Control
- **Agent**: @coding-agent
- **Documentation Links**: User_Management_APIs.md, RBAC_Configuration.json
- **Steps**:
    1. Implement user management APIs and profile handling (edit_file)
        - Success: "users", "profile", "CRUD"
    2. Configure role-based access control system (edit_file)
        - Success: "roles", "permissions", "access.*control"
    3. Test user management and RBAC functionality (run_terminal_cmd)
        - Success: GET /api/users 200 OK, POST /api/users 201 Created, user-management-test-suite
- **Final Subtask Success Criteria**: User management system completed with RBAC implementation, comprehensive APIs, and verified access control functionality.
- **Integration Points**: Provides foundation for all user-related features and security controls throughout the application.
- **Next Subtask**: P04-T04-S01 (Database Integration & ORM Setup)

## Rollback Procedures
- Revert to previous authentication or user management implementation
- Escalate to @security-auditor-agent if repeated failures

## Integration Points
- Provides security and user management foundation for backend

## Quality Gates
- Authentication and user management APIs must be secure and tested

## Success Criteria
- Authentication and user management APIs are functional, secure, and ready for development

## Risk Mitigation
- Use version control for all authentication and user management changes
- Validate with automated and manual tests

## Output Artifacts
- Authentication and user management API code
- Test results and logs

## Next Action
Implement JWT authentication and token management

## Post-Completion Action
Proceed to P04-S13-T04-Database-Integration-and-Data-Management.md
