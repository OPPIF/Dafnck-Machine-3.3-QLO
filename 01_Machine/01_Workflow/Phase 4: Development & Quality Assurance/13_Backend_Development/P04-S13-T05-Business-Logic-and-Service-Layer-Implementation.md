# Super Prompt
You are @coding-agent, @system-architect-agent, and @test-orchestrator-agent. Your mission is to collaboratively implement the business logic layer, service architecture, data validation, business rule enforcement, error handling, and logging for DafnckMachine v3.1 backend. Ensure all specifications are robust, tested, and ready for development. Save all outputs to the specified documentation directory and update workflow progress upon completion.

1. **Documentation Reference**
   - Documentation in  : `01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/13_Backend_Development/`

2. **Collect Data/Input**
   - Reference business logic and service layer requirements
   - Review previous architecture and error handling documentation if available
   - Gather standards for validation, error handling, and logging

3. **Save Output**
   - Save business logic architecture: `Business_Logic_Architecture.md`
   - Save service layer design: `Service_Layer_Design.json`
   - Save error handling guide: `Error_Handling_Guide.md`
   - Save logging configuration: `Logging_Configuration.json`
   - Minimal JSON schema example for service layer design:
     ```json
     {
       "service": "UserService",
       "methods": ["createUser", "getUser", "updateUser", "deleteUser"],
       "validation": true,
       "logging": true
     }
     ```

4. **Update Progress**
   - Upon completion, update `Step.json` and `DNA.json` to mark this task as SUCCEEDED
   - Proceed to the next task: P04-S13-T06

5. **Self-Check**
   - [ ] All required files are present in the documentation directory
   - [ ] Business logic, error handling, and logging are functional and tested
   - [ ] Documentation and configuration are clear and complete
   - [ ] Task status updated in workflow tracking files

## Mission Statement
Implement comprehensive business logic layer with service architecture, data validation, and business rule enforcement for scalable application logic.

## Description
This task covers the implementation of the business logic layer, including service architecture, data validation, business rule enforcement, error handling, and logging systems for robust application operation.

## Super-Prompt
You are @coding-agent. Your mission is to implement the business logic layer, service architecture, data validation, business rule enforcement, error handling, and logging for DafnckMachine v3.1 backend.

## MCP Tools Required

## Primary Responsible Agent
@coding-agent

## Supporting Agents
- @system-architect-agent
- @test-orchestrator-agent

## Agent Selection Criteria
@coding-agent is chosen for its expertise in business logic, service architecture, validation, error handling, and logging implementation.

## Tasks (Summary)
- Implement service layer architecture and business logic
- Configure data validation and business rule enforcement
- Test business logic and service layer functionality
- Implement error handling and exception management
- Configure logging system and monitoring integration
- Test error handling and logging functionality

## Subtasks (Detailed)
### Subtask-01: Business Logic Implementation
- **Agent**: @coding-agent
- **Documentation Links**: Business_Logic_Architecture.md, Service_Layer_Design.json
- **Steps**:
    1. Implement service layer architecture and business logic (edit_file)
        - Success: "service", "business.*logic", "domain"
    2. Configure data validation and business rule enforcement (edit_file)
        - Success: "validation", "rules", "constraints"
    3. Test business logic and service layer functionality (run_terminal_cmd)
        - Success: Exit Code 0, business-logic-test-suite, service-layer-test-suite
- **Final Subtask Success Criteria**: Business logic implemented with service layer architecture, validation systems, and verified functionality for application requirements.
- **Integration Points**: Provides core functionality for all application features and enforces business rules across the system.
- **Next Subtask**: P04-T05-S02 (Error Handling & Logging Systems)

### Subtask-02: Error Handling & Logging Systems
- **Agent**: @coding-agent
- **Documentation Links**: Error_Handling_Guide.md, Logging_Configuration.json
- **Steps**:
    1. Implement error handling and exception management (edit_file)
        - Success: "error.*handling", "exception", "recovery"
    2. Configure logging system and monitoring integration (edit_file)
        - Success: "logging", "monitor", "structured"
    3. Test error handling and logging functionality (run_terminal_cmd)
