2. **Collect Data/Input**
   - Reference security and deployment requirements
   - Review previous security and deployment documentation if available
   - Gather standards for audit, monitoring, and production readiness

3. **Save Output**
   - Save security implementation guide: `Security_Implementation_Guide.md`
   - Save security audit checklist: `Security_Audit_Checklist.json`
   - Save deployment configuration guide: `Deployment_Configuration_Guide.md`
   - Save production deployment specs: `Production_Deployment_Specs.json`
   - Minimal JSON schema example for audit checklist:
     ```json
     {
       "check": "XSS Protection Enabled",
       "status": "passed",
       "details": "Content-Security-Policy header set"
     }
     ```

4. **Update Progress**
   - Upon completion, update `Step.json` and `DNA.json` to mark this task as SUCCEEDED
   - Proceed to the next task: P04-S13-T01

5. **Self-Check**
   - [ ] All required files are present in the documentation directory
   - [ ] Security and deployment meet compliance and operational standards
   - [ ] Documentation and audit results are clear and complete

# Mission Statement
Implement security best practices and deploy the frontend to production for DafnckMachine v3.1, ensuring a secure, stable, and scalable release.

# Description
This task covers the application of frontend security measures (CSP, XSS protection, dependency audits), production build optimization, and deployment to the production environment. The goal is to ensure a secure, performant, and reliable production release.

# Super-Prompt
You are @coding-agent responsible for frontend security and production deployment in DafnckMachine v3.1. Your mission is to ensure the application is secure, optimized, and successfully deployed to production, following best practices in security and deployment automation.

# MCP Tools Required

- file_search
- list_dir
- run_terminal_cmd
- mcp_taskmaster-ai_get_task
- mcp_taskmaster-ai_set_task_status

# Result We Want
- Security implementation completed with client-side protection, authentication integration, and security audit compliance verified and operational.
- Production deployment configured with build optimization, hosting setup, and monitoring integration verified and operational for scalable application delivery.

# Add to Brain
- Security measures and best practices
- Production deployment configuration
- Monitoring and operational readiness

# Primary Responsible Agent
@security-auditor-agent (Security), @devops-agent (Deployment)

# Supporting Agents
- @security-penetration-tester-agent
- @adaptive-deployment-strategist-agent

# Agent Selection Criteria
@security-auditor-agent is selected for security expertise; @devops-agent for deployment. Supporting agents provide penetration testing and deployment strategy.

# Tasks (Summary)
