2. **Collect Data/Input**
   - Reference design system and accessibility requirements
   - Review previous responsive and accessibility documentation if available
   - Gather standards for breakpoints, ARIA, and WCAG compliance

3. **Save Output**
   - Save responsive design guide: `Responsive_Design_Guide.md`
   - Save breakpoint specs: `Breakpoint_Specifications.json`
   - Save accessibility implementation guide: `Accessibility_Implementation_Guide.md`
   - Save WCAG compliance checklist: `WCAG_Compliance_Checklist.json`
   - Minimal JSON schema example for breakpoints:
     ```json
     {
       "breakpoint": "md",
       "minWidth": 768,
       "maxWidth": 1023,
       "appliesTo": ["tablet", "desktop"]
     }
     ```

4. **Update Progress**
   - Upon completion, update `Step.json` and `DNA.json` to mark this task as SUCCEEDED
   - Proceed to the next task: P04-S12-T07

5. **Self-Check**
   - [ ] All required files are present in the documentation directory
   - [ ] Responsive and accessibility features meet standards and compliance
