   - Collect preferences and constraints regarding UI structure, composition, and theming.

3. **Save Output**
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/12_Frontend_Development/Component_Architecture_Design.md (Markdown)
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/12_Frontend_Development/Component_Structure_Specs.json (JSON, schema: {"components": [string], "structure": object, "patterns": [string]})
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/12_Frontend_Development/Design_System_Integration.md (Markdown)
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/12_Frontend_Development/Styling_Configuration.json (JSON, schema: {"tokens": object, "themes": object, "breakpoints": [string]})

4. **Update Progress**
   - Mark this task as done in Step.json and DNA.json when all outputs are complete and reviewed.

5. **Self-Check**
   - [ ] Are all required output files present and complete?
   - [ ] Is the component architecture and design system rationale clearly documented?
   - [ ] Are architecture, integration, and configuration steps justified and reproducible?
   - [ ] Have all blockers and requirements been communicated and addressed?

# Rollback Procedures
- Revert to previous component structure or design system configuration
- Escalate to @ui-designer-agent or @design-system-agent if repeated failures

# Integration Points
- Guides all UI development and ensures consistency
- Enables scalable, maintainable, and visually consistent UI

# Quality Gates
1. Component hierarchy and documentation must be clear
2. Design tokens and theming must be functional
3. Responsive breakpoints must be implemented

# Success Criteria
- Component architecture and design system integration verified and operational

# Risk Mitigation
- Use version control for all structure and design changes
- Validate with design system and UI tests
- Escalate to supporting agents on persistent issues

# Output Artifacts
- Component directory structure
- Component documentation
- Design tokens and theme files
- Responsive layout configuration

# Next Action
Begin component architecture design and design system integration with @coding-agent and @ui-designer-agent

# Post-Completion Action
Update @Step.json and @DNA.json to reflect SUCCEEDED status for this task and proceed to P04-S12-T03-Core-Component-Library-Development.md
