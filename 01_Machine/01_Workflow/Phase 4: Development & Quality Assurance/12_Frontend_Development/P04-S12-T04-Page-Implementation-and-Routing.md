2. **Collect Data/Input**
   - Reference design system and navigation requirements
   - Review previous page and routing documentation if available
   - Gather accessibility and responsive layout standards

3. **Save Output**
   - Save page implementation guide: `Page_Implementation_Guide.md`
   - Save layout specs: `Layout_Specifications.json`
   - Save routing implementation guide: `Routing_Implementation_Guide.md`
   - Save navigation config: `Navigation_Configuration.json`
   - Minimal JSON schema example for layout/navigation:
     ```json
     {
       "page": "Dashboard",
       "route": "/dashboard",
       "layout": "MainLayout",
       "protected": true
     }
     ```

4. **Update Progress**
   - Upon completion, update `Step.json` and `DNA.json` to mark this task as SUCCEEDED
   - Proceed to the next task: P04-S12-T05

5. **Self-Check**

# Primary Responsible Agent
@coding-agent - frontend-development

# Supporting Agents
- @ui-designer-agent
- @development-orchestrator-agent

# Agent Selection Criteria
@coding-agent is selected for expertise in page and routing implementation. Supporting agents provide UI and workflow guidance.

# Tasks (Summary)
- Implement home, dashboard, user profile, and settings pages
- Integrate responsive layouts and navigation
- Configure routing system and protected routes

# Subtasks (Detailed)
## Subtask 1: Core Page Development
- **ID**: P04-T04-S01
- **Description**: Implement essential application pages including home, dashboard, user profile, and settings with responsive layouts and navigation integration.
- **Agent Assignment**: @coding-agent
- **Documentation Links**:
  - [Page_Implementation_Guide.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/12_Frontend_Development/Page_Implementation_Guide.md)
  - [Layout_Specifications.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/12_Frontend_Development/Layout_Specifications.json)
- **Steps**:
    1. Implement home and dashboard pages with layouts (edit_file)

# Rollback Procedures
- Revert to previous working page or routing configuration
- Escalate to @ui-designer-agent or @development-orchestrator-agent if repeated failures

# Integration Points
- Core pages and routing are central to the frontend application
- Enable user navigation and access control

# Quality Gates
1. All pages must be responsive and accessible
2. Routing and navigation must be robust and secure
3. All tests must pass for pages and routing

# Success Criteria
- Pages and routing system are functional, accessible, and tested

# Risk Mitigation
- Use version control for all page and routing changes
- Validate with automated and manual tests
- Escalate to supporting agents on persistent issues

# Output Artifacts
- Page source files
- Routing and navigation configuration
- Test suites and results

# Next Action
Begin implementation of core pages and routing with @coding-agent

# Post-Completion Action
Update @Step.json and @DNA.json to reflect SUCCEEDED status for this task and proceed to P04-S12-T05-State-Management-and-API-Integration.md
