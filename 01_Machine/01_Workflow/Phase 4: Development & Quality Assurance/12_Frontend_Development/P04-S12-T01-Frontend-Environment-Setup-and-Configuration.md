   - Documentation in  `01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/12_Frontend_Development/`

2. **Collect Data/Input**
   - Gather requirements for frontend environment, dependencies, and build configuration from previous steps and team input.
   - Collect preferences and constraints regarding framework, tooling, and development workflow.

3. **Save Output**
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/12_Frontend_Development/Frontend_Environment_Setup.md (Markdown)
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/12_Frontend_Development/Development_Configuration.json (JSON, schema: {"dependencies": [string], "scripts": [string], "settings": object})
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/12_Frontend_Development/Framework_Configuration_Guide.md (Markdown)
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/12_Frontend_Development/Integration_Settings.json (JSON, schema: {"framework": string, "routing": object, "state_management": object, "optimization": object})

4. **Update Progress**
   - Mark this task as done in Step.json and DNA.json when all outputs are complete and reviewed.

5. **Self-Check**
   - [ ] Are all required output files present and complete?
   - [ ] Is the frontend environment setup and configuration rationale clearly documented?
   - [ ] Are configuration and integration steps justified and reproducible?
   - [ ] Have all blockers and requirements been communicated and addressed?

# Mission Statement
Establish a comprehensive frontend development environment with modern tooling, framework configuration, and build optimization for scalable application development in DafnckMachine v3.1.

# Description
This task covers the initialization of the frontend project structure, installation of core dependencies, configuration of the development server and build scripts, and verification of the development environment. The goal is to ensure a robust, scalable, and developer-friendly setup as the foundation for all subsequent frontend work.

# Super-Prompt
You are @coding-agent responsible for initializing the frontend environment for DafnckMachine v3.1. Your mission is to create a modern, maintainable, and scalable development setup using best practices in project structure, dependency management, and build configuration. Ensure the environment is ready for rapid development, testing, and deployment.

# Primary Responsible Agent
@coding-agent - frontend-development

# Supporting Agents
- @ui-designer-agent
- @development-orchestrator-agent
- @test-orchestrator-agent
- @performance-optimization-agent

# Agent Selection Criteria
@coding-agent is selected for expertise in frontend environment setup, dependency management, and build configuration. Supporting agents provide UI, workflow, testing, and performance guidance.

# Tasks (Summary)
- Initialize frontend project structure and install core dependencies
- Configure development server and build scripts
- Verify development environment functionality

# Subtasks (Detailed)
## Subtask 1: Development Environment Initialization
- **ID**: P04-T01-S01

# Rollback Procedures
- Revert to previous working configuration
- Reinstall dependencies and reset project structure
- Escalate to @development-orchestrator-agent if repeated failures

# Integration Points
- Foundation for all frontend development, component creation, and testing
- Enables workflow for subsequent tasks in the frontend phase

# Quality Gates
1. Project structure and dependencies must be correct
2. Development server and build scripts must function as expected
3. Environment must be ready for further frontend work

# Success Criteria
- Functional frontend environment with all checks passed
- Ready for component, page, and feature development

# Risk Mitigation
- Use version control for all configuration changes
- Validate environment with test builds and server runs
- Escalate to @development-orchestrator-agent on persistent issues

# Output Artifacts
- package.json
- node_modules/
- src/ directory structure
- Development server and build scripts

# Next Action
Initialize frontend environment with @coding-agent

# Post-Completion Action
Update @Step.json and @DNA.json to reflect SUCCEEDED status for this task and proceed to P04-S12-T02-Component-Architecture-and-Design-System-Integration.md
