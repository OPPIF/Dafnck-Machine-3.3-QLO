# Super Prompt
@task-planning-agent: Develop and document strategies for resource allocation and timeline management for DafnckMachine v3.1, leveraging TaskMaster data and project documentation. Document all allocation, planning, and optimization steps with clear rationale and evidence. Output all strategy and planning files to the required locations. Communicate blockers or gaps in requirements immediately.

1. **Documentation Reference**
   - Documentation in  `01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4_Development_QA/`

2. **Collect Data/Input**
   - Gather all tasks, team capacity, and skill requirements from tasks.json and supporting documentation.
   - Collect team input and constraints regarding resource allocation and timeline planning.

3. **Save Output**
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4_Development_QA/Resource_Allocation_Strategy.md (Markdown)
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4_Development_QA/Capacity_Planning_Framework.json (JSON, schema: {"team_members": [string], "skills": [string], "capacity": object})
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4_Development_QA/Timeline_Optimization_Plan.md (Markdown)
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4_Development_QA/Milestone_Planning_Framework.json (JSON, schema: {"milestones": [string], "tasks": [string], "critical_paths": [string]})

4. **Update Progress**
   - Mark this task as done in Step.json and DNA.json when all outputs are complete and reviewed.

5. **Self-Check**
   - [ ] Are all required output files present and complete?
   - [ ] Is the resource allocation and timeline management rationale clearly documented?
   - [ ] Are allocation, planning, and optimization steps justified and reproducible?
   - [ ] Have all blockers and requirements been communicated and addressed?

## Mission Statement
Develop strategies for resource allocation and timeline management using TaskMaster data for DafnckMachine v3.1.

## Description
Develop a strategy for allocating resources based on task requirements, team capacity, and skill matching. Optimize the project timeline by planning milestones, identifying critical paths, and mitigating risks.

## Super-Prompt
"You are @task-planning-agent. Your mission is to develop and document strategies for resource allocation and timeline management, leveraging TaskMaster data and project documentation."

## MCP Tools Required
- edit_file
- mcp_taskmaster-ai_get_task
- mcp_taskmaster-ai_next_task

## Result We Want
- A resource allocation strategy is documented.
- Milestone planning and timeline optimization strategies are documented.

## Add to Brain
- Resource Management: Efficient allocation strategies with timeline optimization and milestone tracking

## Documentation & Templates
- [Resource_Allocation_Strategy.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4_Development_QA/Resource_Allocation_Strategy.md)
- [Capacity_Planning_Framework.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4_Development_QA/Capacity_Planning_Framework.json)
- [Timeline_Optimization_Plan.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4_Development_QA/Timeline_Optimization_Plan.md)
- [Milestone_Planning_Framework.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4_Development_QA/Milestone_Planning_Framework.json)

## Primary Responsible Agent
@task-planning-agent

## Supporting Agents
- None

## Agent Selection Criteria
@task-planning-agent is chosen for its expertise in resource-allocation, capacity-planning, timeline-optimization, and milestone-planning.

## Tasks (Summary)
- Document the strategy for assigning tasks to team members, considering workload and skills
- Review task details to ensure sufficient information for resource allocation decisions
- Define key project milestones and map them to TaskMaster tasks or groups of tasks
- Use next_task and dependency information to identify potential critical paths

## Subtasks (Detailed)
### Subtask-01: Resource Allocation Strategy
- **ID:** P04-T09-S01
- **Description:** Develop a strategy for allocating resources based on task requirements, team capacity, and skill matching.
- **Agent:** @task-planning-agent
- **Documentation Links:**
  - [Resource_Allocation_Strategy.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4_Development_QA/Resource_Allocation_Strategy.md)
  - [Capacity_Planning_Framework.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4_Development_QA/Capacity_Planning_Framework.json)
- **Steps:**
    1. Document the strategy for assigning tasks to team members, considering workload and skills using edit_file.
    2. Review task details using mcp_taskmaster-ai_get_task to ensure sufficient information for resource allocation decisions.
- **Success Criteria:**
    - File Exists: 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4_Development_QA/Resource_Allocation_Strategy.md
    - File Content Matches: Strategy document includes guidelines for task assignment
    - Tool Output Contains: Task details that inform skill requirements and effort estimation
- **On Failure:** NOTIFY_AND_CONTINUE (resource allocation will be ad-hoc)
- **Max Retries:** 0
- **Integration Points:** Helps in efficiently utilizing team resources.
- **Next Subtask:** P04-T09-S02

### Subtask-02: Timeline Optimization & Milestone Planning
- **ID:** P04-T09-S02
- **Description:** Optimize the project timeline by planning milestones, identifying critical paths, and mitigating risks.
- **Agent:** @task-planning-agent
- **Documentation Links:**
  - [Timeline_Optimization_Plan.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4_Development_QA/Timeline_Optimization_Plan.md)
  - [Milestone_Planning_Framework.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4_Development_QA/Milestone_Planning_Framework.json)
- **Steps:**
    1. Define key project milestones and map them to TaskMaster tasks or groups of tasks using edit_file.
    2. Use next_task and dependency information from mcp_taskmaster-ai_next_task and mcp_taskmaster-ai_get_task to identify potential critical paths.
- **Success Criteria:**
    - File Exists: 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4_Development_QA/Milestone_Planning_Framework.json
    - File Content Matches: Framework document defines milestones and their associated tasks

- **On Failure:** NOTIFY_AND_CONTINUE (timeline management will be less structured)
- **Max Retries:** 0
- **Integration Points:** Ensures efficient project execution and timely delivery.
- **Next Subtask:** None
