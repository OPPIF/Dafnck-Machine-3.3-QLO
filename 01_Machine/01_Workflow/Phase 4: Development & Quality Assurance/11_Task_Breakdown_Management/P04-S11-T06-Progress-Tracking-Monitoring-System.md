   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4_Development_QA/Analytics_Dashboard_Specifications.md (Markdown)

4. **Update Progress**
   - Mark this task as done in Step.json and DNA.json when all outputs are complete and reviewed.

5. **Self-Check**
   - [ ] Are all required output files present and complete?
   - [ ] Is the progress tracking and analytics rationale clearly documented?
   - [ ] Are tracking, analytics, and reporting guides justified and reproducible?
   - [ ] Have all blockers and requirements been communicated and addressed? 
=======
## Result We Want
- A clear progress tracking framework is documented and basic status updates are functional.
- Analytics and reporting specifications are defined, and data retrieval for reports is confirmed.

## Add to Brain
- Progress Monitoring: Comprehensive analytics and reporting for development visibility and control

## Primary Responsible Agent
@task-planning-agent

## Supporting Agents
- None

## Agent Selection Criteria
@task-planning-agent is chosen for its expertise in progress-tracking, monitoring-setup, analytics-implementation, and reporting-setup.

## Tasks (Summary)
- Define and document task statuses and milestone criteria
- Ensure TaskMaster can set and reflect these statuses correctly
- Define KPIs and reporting requirements for analytics
- Verify that TaskMaster can provide data for these reports

## Subtasks (Detailed)
### Subtask-01: Progress Tracking Framework Setup
- **ID:** P04-T06-S01
- **Description:** Establish the framework for progress tracking, including status management, milestone definition, and reporting metrics.
- **Agent:** @task-planning-agent
- **Documentation Links:**
  - [Progress_Tracking_Framework.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4_Development_QA/Progress_Tracking_Framework.md)
  - [Monitoring_System_Setup.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4_Development_QA/Monitoring_System_Setup.json)
- **Steps:**
    1. Define and document task statuses and milestone criteria using edit_file.
    2. Ensure TaskMaster can set and reflect these statuses correctly for tasks and subtasks using mcp_taskmaster-ai_set_task_status and mcp_taskmaster-ai_get_task.
- **Success Criteria:**
    - File Exists: 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4_Development_QA/Progress_Tracking_Framework.md
