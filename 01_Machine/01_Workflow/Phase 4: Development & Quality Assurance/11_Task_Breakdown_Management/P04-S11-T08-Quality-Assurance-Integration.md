# Super Prompt
@test-orchestrator-agent: Integrate QA processes and testing workflows with TaskMaster for DafnckMachine v3.1, and establish quality gates and validation frameworks. Document all integration steps, quality gates, and validation procedures with clear rationale and evidence. Output all QA and quality gate files to the required locations. Communicate blockers or gaps in requirements immediately.

1. **Documentation Reference**
   - Documentation in  `01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4_Development_QA/`

2. **Collect Data/Input**
   - Gather requirements for QA integration and quality gates from previous steps and team input.
   - Collect preferences and constraints regarding testing workflows and validation processes.

3. **Save Output**
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4_Development_QA/Testing_Workflow_Integration.md (Markdown)
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4_Development_QA/QA_Coordination_Framework.json (JSON, schema: {"qa_processes": [string], "integration_points": [string], "milestones": [string]})
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4_Development_QA/Quality_Assurance_Integration.md (Markdown)
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4_Development_QA/Quality_Gates_Framework.md (Markdown)
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4_Development_QA/Validation_Process_Specs.json (JSON, schema: {"gates": [string], "criteria": [string], "taskmaster_mapping": object})

4. **Update Progress**
   - Mark this task as done in Step.json and DNA.json when all outputs are complete and reviewed.

5. **Self-Check**
   - [ ] Are all required output files present and complete?
   - [ ] Is the QA integration and quality gates rationale clearly documented?
   - [ ] Are integration steps and validation procedures justified and reproducible?
   - [ ] Have all blockers and requirements been communicated and addressed?

## Mission Statement
Integrate quality assurance (QA) processes and testing workflows with TaskMaster for DafnckMachine v3.1.

## Description
Integrate the testing workflow, including test case generation and QA milestone tracking within TaskMaster. Establish quality gates and a validation framework, defining checkpoints and acceptance criteria.

## Super-Prompt
"You are @test-orchestrator-agent. Your mission is to integrate QA processes and testing workflows with TaskMaster, and establish quality gates and validation frameworks."

## MCP Tools Required
- edit_file
- mcp_taskmaster-ai_add_subtask
- mcp_taskmaster-ai_update_task
- mcp_taskmaster-ai_set_task_status
- mcp_taskmaster-ai_get_task

## Result We Want
- Procedures for integrating testing tasks into TaskMaster are documented and demonstrated.
- Quality gates and validation framework are documented and demonstrable within TaskMaster.

## Add to Brain
- Quality Assurance: Integrated testing workflow with quality gates and validation processes

## Documentation & Templates

## Primary Responsible Agent
@test-orchestrator-agent

## Supporting Agents
- None

## Agent Selection Criteria
@test-orchestrator-agent is chosen for its expertise in testing-integration, qa-workflow, quality-gates, and validation-framework.

## Tasks (Summary)
- Define how test cases and testing tasks will be created and linked as subtasks or dependent tasks in TaskMaster
- Add a sample testing subtask to an existing development task
- Define quality gates and how they map to task statuses or custom fields in TaskMaster
- Update a sample task to reflect passing a quality gate

## Subtasks (Detailed)
### Subtask-01: Testing Workflow Integration
- **ID:** P04-T08-S01
- **Description:** Integrate the testing workflow, including test case generation and QA milestone tracking within TaskMaster.
- **Agent:** @test-orchestrator-agent
- **Documentation Links:**
  - [Testing_Workflow_Integration.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4_Development_QA/Testing_Workflow_Integration.md)
  - [QA_Coordination_Framework.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4_Development_QA/QA_Coordination_Framework.json)
  - [Quality_Assurance_Integration.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4_Development_QA/Quality_Assurance_Integration.md)
- **Steps:**
    1. Define how test cases and testing tasks will be created and linked as subtasks or dependent tasks in TaskMaster using edit_file.
    2. Add a sample testing subtask to an existing development task using mcp_taskmaster-ai_add_subtask.
- **Success Criteria:**
    - File Exists: 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4_Development_QA/Quality_Assurance_Integration.md

- **Integration Points:** Enforces quality standards throughout the development process.
- **Next Subtask:** None
