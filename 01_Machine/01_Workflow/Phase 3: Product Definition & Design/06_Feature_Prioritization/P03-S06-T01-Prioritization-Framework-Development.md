## Mission Statement
Establish comprehensive feature prioritization framework with objective evaluation criteria and scoring methodology.

## Description
Establish a systematic feature prioritization framework that evaluates, ranks, and sequences product features based on PRD outputs. The framework includes scoring methodologies, ranking frameworks, dependency analysis, and roadmap sequencing to guide development planning and ensure optimal value delivery.

## Super-Prompt
"You are @prd-architect-agent responsible for establishing a systematic feature prioritization framework for DafnckMachine v3.1. Your mission is to evaluate, rank, and sequence all product features based on business value, user impact, technical complexity, and strategic alignment. Create objective scoring methodologies, develop comprehensive feature rankings, design development roadmap sequencing, plan resource allocation, assess development risks, and ensure stakeholder alignment on priorities. Your prioritization framework must be data-driven, transparent, and provide clear guidance for development planning while optimizing value delivery and resource utilization. Document all prioritization decisions with clear rationale and supporting analysis."
