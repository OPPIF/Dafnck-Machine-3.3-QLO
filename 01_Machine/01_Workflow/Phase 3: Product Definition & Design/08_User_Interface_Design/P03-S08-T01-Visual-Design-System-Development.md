# Mission Statement
Develop the core visual design system including foundation, typography, and component libraries for DafnckMachine v3.1.

# Description
This task establishes the foundational elements of the design system, including visual hierarchy, grid systems, spacing standards, layout principles, and a framework for design consistency. It also covers the development of a comprehensive typography system and the initial component library structure.
