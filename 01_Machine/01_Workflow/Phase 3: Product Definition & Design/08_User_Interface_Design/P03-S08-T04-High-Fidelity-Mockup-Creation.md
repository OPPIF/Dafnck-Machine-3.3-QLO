# Super Prompt
You are @ui-designer-agent. Your mission is to create pixel-perfect, high-fidelity mockups for all key screens and user flows for DafnckMachine v3.1, ensuring responsive design and clear depiction of all interface states. Coordinate with @uber-orchestrator-agent as needed.

1. **Documentation Reference**
   - Documentation in  `01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/08_User_Interface_Design/`

2. **Collect Data/Input**
   - Gather all wireframes, user flows, and state requirements for key screens.

3. **Save Output**
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/08_User_Interface_Design/Visual_Design_Mockups.md (Markdown)
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/08_User_Interface_Design/Screen_Layout_Specifications.json (JSON)
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/08_User_Interface_Design/User_Flow_Mockups.md (Markdown)
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/08_User_Interface_Design/Interaction_State_Specifications.json (JSON)
   - Output JSON schemas must include: { "screens": [ ... ], "flows": [ ... ], "states": [ ... ] }

4. **Update Progress**
   - Mark this task as complete in Step.json and DNA.json upon successful documentation delivery.

5. **Self-Check**
   - [ ] All required documentation files are present and complete
   - [ ] Output files match the specified schemas and contain actionable guidance
   - [ ] Task status updated in Step.json and DNA.json

# Primary Responsible Agent
@ui-designer-agent

# Supporting Agents
- @design-system-agent

# Agent Selection Criteria
The UI Designer Agent is chosen for its expertise in mockup design, screen layouts, responsive mockups, and flow visualization. The Design System Agent supports consistency.

# Tasks (Summary)
1. Create high-fidelity mockups for key screens (homepage, dashboard, main features, responsive layouts, state variations)
2. Visualize complete user flows (step-by-step interfaces, transitions, feedback, error/success states)

# Subtasks (Detailed)
## Subtask 1: Key Screen Design
- **ID**: P03-T04-S01
- **Description**: Create high-fidelity mockups for key screens, including responsive layouts and state variations.
- **Agent**: @ui-designer-agent
- **Documentation Links**:
  - [Visual Design Mockups](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/08_User_Interface_Design/Visual_Design_Mockups.md)
  - [Screen Layout Specifications](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/08_User_Interface_Design/Screen_Layout_Specifications.json)
- **Steps**:
  1. Transform UX wireframes into high-fidelity mockups for homepage, dashboard, and main features. (file_search, edit_file)
  2. Design responsive layouts and state variations for key screens. (edit_file)
- **Success Criteria**:
  - File Exists: Visual_Design_Mockups.md
  - File Content Matches: 'homepageMockup': { 'status': 'completed' }
