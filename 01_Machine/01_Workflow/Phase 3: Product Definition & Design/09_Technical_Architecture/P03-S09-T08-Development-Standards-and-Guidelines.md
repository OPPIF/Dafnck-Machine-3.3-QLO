# Subtasks (Detailed)
## Subtask-01: Coding Standards & Best Practices
- **ID**: P03-T08-S01
- **Description**: Establish coding standards, including code style, naming conventions, documentation standards, code review processes, and quality metrics.
- **Agent Assignment**: @system-architect-agent (coding-standards, development-practices)
- **Documentation Links**:
  - [Coding_Standards_Guidelines.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/09_Technical_Architecture/Coding_Standards_Guidelines.md)
  - [Development_Best_Practices.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/09_Technical_Architecture/Development_Best_Practices.json)
- **Steps**:
  1. Establish coding standards: define code style guidelines, naming conventions, documentation standards, code review processes, and quality metrics (CognitiveProcessing)
  2. Document the coding standards and guidelines in Coding_Standards_Guidelines.md (edit_file)
  3. Summarize key development best practices in Development_Best_Practices.json (edit_file)
- **Success Criteria**:
