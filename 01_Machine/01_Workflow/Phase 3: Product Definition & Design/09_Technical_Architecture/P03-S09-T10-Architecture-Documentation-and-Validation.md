2. **Collect Data/Input**
   - Gather all technical documentation, specifications, and review feedback from previous steps and team discussions.

3. **Save Output**
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/09_Technical_Architecture/Complete_Technical_Architecture.md (Markdown)
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/09_Technical_Architecture/Implementation_Guidelines.json (JSON, schema: {"guidelines": [string], "references": [string]})
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/09_Technical_Architecture/Architecture_Validation_Report.md (Markdown)
   - 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/09_Technical_Architecture/Technical_Review_Results.json (JSON, schema: {"findings": [string], "actions": [string]})

4. **Update Progress**
   - Mark this task as done in Step.json and DNA.json when all outputs are complete and reviewed.

5. **Self-Check**
   - [ ] Are all required output files present and complete?
   - [ ] Is the architecture validated for feasibility, scalability, security, and readiness?
   - [ ] Are all technical guidelines and review results documented?
   - [ ] Have all critical issues been communicated and addressed?

# Primary Responsible Agent
@system-architect-agent

# Supporting Agents
- @devops-agent

# Agent Selection Criteria
The @system-architect-agent is chosen for its expertise in documentation, technical review, and architecture validation, ensuring readiness for development.

# Tasks (Summary)
- Compile all technical documentation and validate the overall architecture.

# Subtasks (Detailed)
## Subtask-01: Technical Documentation Compilation
- **ID**: P03-T10-S01
- **Description**: Compile all technical documentation, including architecture overview, implementation guidelines, technical specifications, integration guides, and maintenance procedures.
- **Agent Assignment**: @system-architect-agent (documentation-compilation, technical-specifications)
- **Documentation Links**:
  - [Complete_Technical_Architecture.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/09_Technical_Architecture/Complete_Technical_Architecture.md)
  - [Implementation_Guidelines.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/09_Technical_Architecture/Implementation_Guidelines.json)
- **Steps**:
  1. Compile technical documentation: consolidate all previously created documents into a cohesive architecture overview, develop implementation guidelines, summarize technical specifications, create integration guides, and outline maintenance procedures (CognitiveProcessing)
  2. Create or update the main Complete_Technical_Architecture.md document (edit_file)
  3. Structure key implementation guidelines in Implementation_Guidelines.json (edit_file)
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Complete technical documentation, including a comprehensive architecture overview, detailed specifications, and implementation guidelines, is compiled and organized.
  - InternalState: All technical documentation compiled and organized.
- **Integration Points**: This consolidated documentation serves as the definitive guide for Phase 4 development and implementation efforts.
