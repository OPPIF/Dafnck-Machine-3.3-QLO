# Tasks (Summary)
- Design the API architecture and plan for system integrations.

# Subtasks (Detailed)
## Subtask-01: API Design & Specification
- **ID**: P03-T04-S01
- **Description**: Design the API architecture, including endpoint design, request/response specifications, authentication, rate limiting, and versioning.
- **Agent Assignment**: @system-architect-agent (api-design, interface-specification)
- **Documentation Links**:
  - [API_Design_Specifications.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/09_Technical_Architecture/API_Design_Specifications.md)
  - [Endpoint_Documentation.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/09_Technical_Architecture/Endpoint_Documentation.json)
- **Steps**:
  1. Design API architecture: define RESTful/GraphQL endpoints, request/response payloads, HTTP methods, status codes, authentication/authorization mechanisms, rate limiting, and versioning (CognitiveProcessing)
  2. Document the API design specifications in API_Design_Specifications.md (edit_file)
  3. Generate or populate Endpoint_Documentation.json with a structured list of all API endpoints and their key properties (edit_file)
