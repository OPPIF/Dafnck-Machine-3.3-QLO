# Tasks (Summary)
- Design the database schema and establish a comprehensive data management strategy.

# Subtasks (Detailed)
## Subtask-01: Database Design & Schema Planning
- **ID**: P03-T03-S01
- **Description**: Design the database schema, including relationship modeling, indexing strategy, normalization, and query performance optimization.
- **Agent Assignment**: @system-architect-agent (database-design, schema-architecture)
- **Documentation Links**:
  - [Database_Schema_Design.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/09_Technical_Architecture/Database_Schema_Design.md)
  - [Data_Model_Specifications.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/09_Technical_Architecture/Data_Model_Specifications.json)
- **Steps**:
  1. Design database architecture: schema design, relationship modeling, indexing strategy, normalization optimization, query performance based on selected backend technology and application requirements (CognitiveProcessing)
  2. Document the database schema design, including diagrams, table definitions, relationships, and indexing strategies in Database_Schema_Design.md (edit_file)
  3. Populate Data_Model_Specifications.json with structured details of the data models and entities (edit_file)
- **Success Criteria**:
  - An optimized database schema ensuring efficient data modeling and query performance is documented in Database_Schema_Design.md and Data_Model_Specifications.json.
  - InternalState: Database schema and data model designed.
- **Integration Points**: The database design directly guides data management implementation, API development, and ORM configuration.
