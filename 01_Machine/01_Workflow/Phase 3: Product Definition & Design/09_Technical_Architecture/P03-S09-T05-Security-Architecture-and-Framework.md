# Tasks (Summary)
- Design the security architecture and establish a comprehensive security framework.

# Subtasks (Detailed)
## Subtask-01: Authentication & Authorization Design
- **ID**: P03-T05-S01
- **Description**: Design the security framework, focusing on authentication mechanisms, authorization policies, session management, token security, and multi-factor authentication.
- **Agent Assignment**: @security-auditor-agent (authentication-design, authorization-framework)
- **Documentation Links**:
  - [Security_Architecture_Framework.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/09_Technical_Architecture/Security_Architecture_Framework.md)
  - [Authentication_Specifications.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/09_Technical_Architecture/Authentication_Specifications.json)
- **Steps**:
  1. Research and select appropriate authentication mechanisms and authorization models. Design session management, token security, and MFA integration points (web_search, CognitiveProcessing)
  2. Design the detailed authentication and authorization framework (CognitiveProcessing)
  3. Document the complete security architecture framework in Security_Architecture_Framework.md (edit_file)
  4. Specify detailed authentication parameters and configurations in Authentication_Specifications.json (edit_file)
- **Success Criteria**:
  - A comprehensive security framework with robust authentication and authorization mechanisms is documented in Security_Architecture_Framework.md and Authentication_Specifications.json.
  - Output Contains: Comparison of authentication mechanisms and authorization models.
