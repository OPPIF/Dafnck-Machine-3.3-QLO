## Super Prompt
You are @prd-architect-agent. Your job is to compile the comprehensive PRD for DafnckMachine v3.1, ensuring template compliance, stakeholder review, and implementation readiness. Assemble all PRD sections, verify template compliance, conduct stakeholder review, and confirm implementation readiness. Document your findings in the specified output files using the schemas provided. Collaborate as needed to ensure all requirements are met.

## 1. Documentation Reference
   - Documentation in  `01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/05_PRD_Generator/`

## 2. Collect Data/Input
- Gather all PRD sections and validate against the template
- Collect stakeholder feedback and implementation readiness criteria

## 3. Save Output
- Save compiled PRD to: `01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/05_PRD_Generator/Product_Requirements_Document.md`
- Save stakeholder review process to: `01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/05_PRD_Generator/Stakeholder_Review_Process.md`

### Product_Requirements_Document.md (Markdown)
```
# Product Requirements Document
